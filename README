# BetaRadio - An easy way listening to Internet radios of Taiwan in GNU/Linux.

![Demo](https://archive.sylee.org/projects/betaradio.png)

With this client you was able to listen to hiChannel radio (disappeared) , PTT Radio (disappeared), Pinewave Radio (disappeared), and THBS (disappeared) without opening a browser, but those radio sites have stopped the service.

It displays a icon on system tray that you can click and select the channel you want to listen to.
